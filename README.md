# CSE 330 (Operating Systems) 

This is the public repository for Operating Systems taught in Spring 2024 by Adil Ahmad.

## Branch: Process Memory Allocation

Memory management is one of the operating systemsâ€™ primary responsibilities. When programs are running on a computer, the operating system must allocate memory to programs, track allocated regions, and free it later.  Operating systems manage memory in part by creating a page table for each program. 

In this assignment, we will create a kernel module that handles allocation and free requests from a process. These allocations and free requests are similar to the `mmap` and `munmap` system calls we discussed in class. 

Please refer to Canvas for details about solving this project.
